1: CosmPSPy: 

The example for how to use the code can be found in 

https://github.com/FeiQin-cosmologist/Galaxy_Power_Spectrum/blob/main/CosmPSPy/Code/Examp_PS.ipynb

To install the PYTHON package 'CosmPSPy', the users can simply download the 'PSestFun.py' and 'PSmodFun.py' from 

https://github.com/FeiQin-cosmologist/Galaxy_Power_Spectrum/tree/main/CosmPSPy/Code 

to their laptop, then importing them using:

from PSestFun import *

from PSmodFun import *

So easy !!! The "PSestFun.py" is used to measure the power spectrum, while the "PSmodFun.py" is used to model the power spectrum. The 'CosmPSPy' can be downloaded from the GitHub link: 

https://github.com/FeiQin-cosmologist/Galaxy_Power_Spectrum/tree/main/CosmPSPy . 

The following Python packages are required to be installed for our code:

1: numpy

2: scipy
